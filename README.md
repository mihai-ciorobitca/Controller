# Controller
The project mean to be an web application to animmate a roundabout intersection with 4 lanes where cars start coming when a button is pressed. This represent a simulation of a real intersection where a centralized controller has to manage cars to pass the intersection safety and minimize the time travel. The application consists of a main page to with the intersections and user controllers to start/stop the simulation plus a field for scale the intersection island size, and second page to visualize the performance of the application. The technology used includes: HTML, CSS, JS, Python and Photoshop.
